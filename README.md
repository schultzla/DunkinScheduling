Designed when I was a shift lead at Dunkin' Donuts, allows users to retrieve their weekly schedule

## More Information

Instead of using a paper schedule, this allows a user to put in their name and get their weekly scheduly

## Current Features

* Get schedule by name

## TODO
No longer in development

* Add ability to add schedule in app
* Better login management
